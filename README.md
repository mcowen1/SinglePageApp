Demo of Server Side Single Page App using MultiView

If you are like me, coding quickly and cheaply means the difference between working and not working, so Rapid Application Development is not a choice but an imperative in today's contract work environment.

This application will be of particular interest to those of us doing this type of contract programming.

It is part of a RAD development series I am working on that provides Rapid Application Development methods that I would like to share.

Server Side Single Page Responsive Application without JavaScript provide a very fast development cycle yet offer the best in design and usability.

This is a demonstration of how to achieve a single page responsive application using asp.MultiView and BootStrap.

For those who have never used MultiView you will find it very simple to use and gives a huge payoff in terms of development time over developing SPA’s using jQuery.

This app, also, demonstrates the ease of use of the server side GridView which is easy to populate and manipulate and then the app goes on to display Add/Edit  pages within their own asp.view’s.

NOTE: This application uses a simple List to populate the GridView. In production, of course you would switch this for a DataTable from your Database.  I have made no attempt to persist changes to the Records as my intention, here, is only to demo the ListView and the use of server side controls.
